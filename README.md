Interesting things I found: if you push an EMPTY README.md, github thinks you don't have a README.md. 
But if you push the button to add one, and then make one, it gets very confused and won't do it.

Hey! maybe I found a github bug-ette.

It did let me edit the empty README.md, and maybe now that there's text in it it will stop telling me I don't have one.

In anycase, that is all bonus material. The outcomes for this week are to understand:
* network
* remote
* origin
* fetch/pull
* push
... probably some others I've forgotten...
